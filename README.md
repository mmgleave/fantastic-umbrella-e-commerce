# Description
** The E-Commerce Store Database ** is an interactive Express.js API which uses the latest technologies to assist the user in managing their e-commerce back-end.

## Installation
Clone the github respository from https://github.com/mmgleave/fantastic-umbrella-e-commerce.

## Usage
Within vs code open the main directory and add your database name, MySql username, and MySql password to an environment variable file (.env). Within Terminal, enter the command "npm run seed" to seed the database with test data and create the database. Within Insomnia, go to "http://localhost:3001/api/" then one of the categories, products, or tags routes. You can then use GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE commands to show, create, update, and delete items in the database.
